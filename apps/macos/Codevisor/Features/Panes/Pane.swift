//  The pane abstraction for workspace content.
//
//  A pane is a self-contained content unit (terminal today; logs, previews,
//  ... later). Panes never see SessionController or the session UI — they
//  receive a PaneContext (exposed data) at creation and lifecycle hooks from
//  the group. Adding a new pane kind = a PaneKind case (CodevisorCore), a Pane
//  conformance, and a branch in the group's factory.
