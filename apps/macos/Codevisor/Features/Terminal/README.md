# Workspace Terminals (libghostty)

Terminals live in workspace tabs and split panes, alongside chats and plugins.
The sidebar lists those tabs, and each terminal uses its workspace's directory.

> **Status: live.** `GhosttyKit.xcframework` is built and linked, so each pane
> runs a real libghostty terminal. The framework and runtime resources are
> required build inputs; missing Ghostty assets should fail the build.

## How GhosttyKit was built & linked (for rebuilds)

1. Build the static-lib xcframework (needs Zig 0.15.2 + the Metal Toolchain).
   Ghostty's required Zig 0.15.2 can't link against the macOS 26/27 *beta* SDK,
   so force a stable SDK that has an `arm64` slice via an `xcrun` shim:
   ```sh
   xcodebuild -downloadComponent MetalToolchain   # one-time
   # shim: make `xcrun --show-sdk-path` return a stable arm64 SDK
   #   e.g. /Library/Developer/CommandLineTools/SDKs/MacOSX15.2.sdk
   cd .repos/ghostty
   zig build -Demit-xcframework=true -Dxcframework-target=universal -Doptimize=ReleaseFast
   # → .repos/ghostty/macos/GhosttyKit.xcframework ; copied to repo Frameworks/
   ```
2. Linked into the Codevisor target via build settings:
   - `SWIFT_INCLUDE_PATHS` points at the GhosttyKit macOS slice headers.
   - `OTHER_LDFLAGS = -force_load .../libghostty-internal-fat.a -lc++` + Metal,
     MetalKit, QuartzCore, CoreText, CoreGraphics, CoreVideo, IOSurface, IOKit,
     Carbon, AppKit, Foundation, CoreFoundation, Security, ApplicationServices,
     AudioToolbox, UniformTypeIdentifiers, GameController, Combine.

`CodevisorGhosttyApp` writes a temp config with the app's terminal font size so
the embedded terminal scale matches the rest of the app chrome. It deliberately
sets no `font-family`: libghostty compiles its default font (JetBrains Mono +
Symbols Nerd Font) into the static library, so leaving the family unset renders
the same glyphs, metrics, and ligatures as stock Ghostty.

**Resources:** the `xterm-ghostty` terminfo + shell-integration are bundled as
`Codevisor/Resources/ghostty-resources.tar.gz` (layout: `ghostty/shell-integration`
+ `terminfo/{67,78}`). On first launch `CodevisorGhosttyApp` extracts it to
`~/Library/Application Support/Codevisor/ghostty-resources/` and sets
`GHOSTTY_RESOURCES_DIR=<that>/ghostty` **before `ghostty_init`** (it captures the
dir at init). The server separately ships the compiled entries from
`packages/terminal/resources/terminfo` in both macOS's hexadecimal (`67/`,
`78/`) and Linux's first-character (`g/`, `x/`) lookup layouts; actual shell
PTYs use `TERM=xterm-ghostty` on macOS and `TERM=xterm-256color` on Linux,
alongside `COLORTERM=truecolor`. Only macOS receives
`TERMINFO=<bundled dir>`; Linux uses its system `xterm-256color` entry so the
Ghostty-only directory cannot mask standard entries in Zsh. When regenerating
the tarball after a Ghostty bump, also refresh the two canonical server-side
terminfo files from the same `zig-out/share` directory and copy them into the
Linux buckets so the renderer and advertised capabilities stay in sync.

## What's implemented

- **Workspace tabs and splits:** terminal panes share the workspace layout with
  chats, plugins, and documents. Open a New Tab and choose a terminal.
- **Focus routing:** selecting a terminal focuses its surface. Selecting a chat
  returns focus to that chat's composer; tab and split shortcuts follow the
  active pane.
- **Persistent terminal sessions:** pane models retain live surfaces while tabs
  and workspaces change, and server-owned shells can be reattached.

The terminal backend is selected at launch via `TerminalRuntime`, and the only
supported backend is the real libghostty surface.

## Architecture (since the vendoring)

The surface/input layer is **upstream Ghostty's own Swift code**, vendored at
the same commit as the xcframework — see
`Codevisor/Vendor/GhosttySwift/UPSTREAM.md` for the manifest, patch inventory,
and re-sync workflow (`scripts/sync-ghostty-swift.sh`). This provides the full
input stack: NSTextInputClient/IME + marked text, `performKeyEquivalent`
(⌘V paste, ⌘C copy), correct key encoding (`consumed_mods`,
`unshifted_codepoint`, kitty keyboard protocol), mouse tracking areas
(selection anchoring, hover), `viewDidChangeBackingProperties` (multi-DPI),
clipboard read/write callbacks with paste protection, and secure-input handling.

Codevisor-owned pieces in this directory:

- `CodevisorGhosttyApp.swift` — process-wide runtime host (replaces upstream's
  `Ghostty.App`): owns `ghostty_app_t` + themed `Ghostty.Config`, implements the
  clipboard/wakeup callbacks and a per-surface `action_cb` subset; window/tab/
  split actions are unhandled by design.
- `GhosttyTerminalSurface.swift` — implements `TerminalSurface` by
  wrapping the vendored `Ghostty.SurfaceView`; maps `TerminalLaunchDescriptor`
  (cwd + codevisor-terminal-proxy command) to `Ghostty.SurfaceConfiguration`.

## Rebuilding the terminal

1. **Build the framework** (needs Zig 0.15.2 and a *stable* macOS SDK — see the
   caveat below):

   ```sh
   scripts/build-ghostty.sh
   ```

   This produces `Codevisor/Frameworks/GhosttyKit.xcframework`.

2. **Keep it linked into the app target** through the Xcode build settings or
   release-script overrides: `SWIFT_INCLUDE_PATHS` must point at the GhosttyKit
   headers and `OTHER_LDFLAGS` must force-load `libghostty-internal-fat.a`.

3. Build & run. If GhosttyKit or the bundled resources are missing, fix the
   packaging issue instead of shipping a degraded terminal.

### SDK caveat (why it isn't built here)

Ghostty's `build.zig` hard-requires **Zig 0.15.2**, but Zig 0.15.2 cannot link
native arm64 binaries against the **macOS 26/27 beta SDK** (its `libSystem.tbd`
only exposes `arm64e`/`x86_64`, not plain `arm64`). Zig 0.16 links fine but is
rejected by Ghostty's build. Build the framework on a machine with a **released**
macOS SDK (or once toolchain support lands), then drop the xcframework in.

## Notes / future work

- Not vendored (candidates for later): `SurfaceScrollView` (native scrollbar
  overlay), child-exited message bar, URL-hover banner, terminal inspector UI.
- Bundle `codevisor-terminal-proxy` inside the .app so the terminal works without
  node/Homebrew on the user's machine (see `TerminalProxyCommand`).
