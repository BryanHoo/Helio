        <p>
          These Terms of Service are between you and Codevisor LLC (“Codevisor,” “we,” or “us”).
          They govern Codevisor Cloud, our website, and the services we provide through our desktop
          and iOS apps and optional browser extension (the “Services”). Software licenses are
          addressed separately below.
        </p>
        <p>
          By selecting a button that states you agree to these terms, or otherwise expressly
          accepting them, you agree to this contract. If you do not agree, do not create an account
          or use our hosted Services. You must be legally able to enter this agreement. If you need
          a parent or guardian’s permission under applicable law, they must agree on your behalf. If
          you accept for an organization, you must have authority to bind it, and “you” includes
          that organization.
        </p>
        <p>
          These terms cover services operated by Codevisor LLC. If you use a Cloud server operated
          by someone else, that operator’s terms apply to its service. These terms do not restrict
          rights granted by the separate software licenses described below.

          Provide accurate account information and keep your sign-in accounts, devices, connection
          credentials, and provider keys secure. Only connect computers, repositories, browser
          sessions, and service accounts that you own or have permission to use. You are responsible
          for the access you grant and for activity you authorize through your account.
        </p>
        <p>
          Tell us promptly at <a href="mailto:hello@codevisor.dev">hello@codevisor.dev</a> if you
          believe your Codevisor account has been compromised. Remove affected connections and
          revoke credentials through the relevant provider. Codevisor Cloud helps connect devices;
          it is not a backup service for files or work on your computers.

        <p>
          Codevisor lets you direct agent tools on connected computers. Depending on the task and
          permissions you configure, an agent can read, create, change, or delete files, execute
          terminal commands, install software, access websites, and send information or take actions
          through connected accounts. Some actions can spend money or have effects that cannot
          easily be reversed.
        </p>
        <p>
          You authorize the actions you request and the access you enable. Review agent permissions
          and approval settings, keep backups, and check changes before using them in production or
          sharing them. Turning off an approval prompt or allowing unattended work can permit an
          agent to act without asking again. Disconnecting your phone or closing the app may not
          stop a task already running on a connected computer.
        </p>
        <p>
          AI output can be inaccurate, incomplete, insecure, or similar to other users’ output. We
          do not guarantee its correctness, originality, or suitability for your purpose. You are
          responsible for evaluating output and obtaining any permissions needed to use it. Do not
          rely on the Services as the sole safeguard for decisions or systems where an error could
          cause serious harm.

          You retain your rights in the prompts, code, files, attachments, and other material you
          provide (“Your Content”). We do not claim ownership of Your Content or AI output merely
          because you use Codevisor. Rights in output may depend on applicable law, the selected
          provider’s terms, and any third-party material it contains.
        </p>
        <p>
          You give us a limited, nonexclusive permission to process, store, and transmit Your
          Content only as needed to provide and secure the Services you use and carry out your
          instructions. This includes using service providers for those purposes as described in our{" "}
          <a href="/privacy">Privacy Policy</a>. This permission does not give us a general right to
          publish your private projects, sell Your Content, or use it to train AI models.
        </p>
        <p>
          You must have the rights and permissions needed to provide Your Content and direct its
          use, including permission to share another person’s information or your employer’s code.
          Retention and deletion are described in our Privacy Policy. Third-party providers you
          choose handle the content they receive under their own terms and policies.

        <p>
          AI providers, agent tools, plugins, websites, and other integrations are separate
          products. You choose which to use and must follow their applicable terms, eligibility
          requirements, and account limits. Their availability, behavior, security, and treatment of
          your data can change independently of Codevisor. A directory listing or integration does
          not guarantee a third party’s quality or safety.
        </p>
        <p>
          Installing a plugin can run code on your connected computer. Browser features can make
          signed-in website sessions available to an agent. Review what you install and connect, and
          grant only the access you intend. We are responsible for the Services we provide; third
          parties are responsible for their products, subject to applicable law.

        <p>
          By submitting a plugin to our registry, including by publishing a repository with the
          codevisor-plugin topic, you agree to these publisher requirements. You must have the
          rights to distribute the plugin, describe its functionality and data practices accurately,
          and keep its source, metadata, and age rating current. Do not publish unlawful, abusive,
          deceptive, malicious, or objectionable content, or code that bypasses our safeguards.
        </p>
        <p>
          Declare an ageRating of 4, 9, 13, 16, or 18 in the plugin manifest, reflecting its content
          and functionality under Apple’s age-rating criteria. Plugins available in Codevisor on iOS
          must fit within our supported 16+ rating. Plugins with a higher or missing rating cannot
          open on iOS. Publishers must moderate any user-generated content their plugins provide and
          must not conceal mature content behind an inaccurate rating.
        </p>
        <p>
          We may review, filter, remove, or restrict any plugin or publisher from the registry or
          iOS app, including for safety, privacy, age suitability, legal obligations, or App Store
          requirements. Report a plugin using its flag button. We review reports and may contact its
          publisher, correct its classification, or block it. These restrictions do not necessarily
          disable software running independently on your Mac.
        </p>
        <p>
          The installation notice names the individual plugin receiving your consent. Installing
          allows that plugin to run on your computer, access resources available to its process, and
          receive workspace context and information you provide through its panes or tools across
          your connected devices. This permission does not grant iPhone system permissions. Plugins
          must obtain any additional consent their own processing requires and provide appropriate
          privacy information. Unlisted plugins are not endorsed by Codevisor.

          Codevisor does not include third-party subscriptions, API credits, hosting, or network
          service unless an offer expressly says so. You are responsible for charges from the
          providers you use, including usage generated by agents you authorize. Those providers
          handle their own billing, cancellation, and refunds.
        </p>
        <p>
          Agreeing to these terms does not by itself authorize a charge from Codevisor. Any paid
          Codevisor offer will disclose its price, billing period, renewal terms, and cancellation
          conditions before you purchase. Applicable purchase terms and mandatory refund rights
          govern that purchase.

          Those licenses govern your rights to use, copy, modify, and distribute the covered
          software and take priority over these terms for that software. Other included components

          separately using the relevant computer or provider controls.

          We may restrict or suspend hosted access when reasonably necessary to address a material
          breach of these terms, security threats, unlawful activity, or harm to the Services or
          others. We may terminate an account for serious or repeated violations. When practicable
