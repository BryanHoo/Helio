          Cloud connects your devices through an account. When you sign in with Apple or GitHub, we
          receive a provider account identifier and the profile information the provider supplies,
          such as your name, email address, and profile image. Apple may supply a private relay
          email address. We store linked sign-in records and authentication tokens needed to
          maintain your account and revoke Apple authorization when you delete it.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you create an account with email and password, we store your email address and a
          password hash. We use short-lived, single-use codes to verify your email and reset your
          password. Resend processes your email address and these messages to deliver the codes; we
          do not send your password to Resend.
        </p>
        <p>
          Cloud stores registered-machine names and identifiers, operating system and app version,
          public encryption keys, connection status, and last-seen times. Authentication and
          operational records can include IP addresses, browser or device information, timestamps,
          connection identifiers, errors, and traffic counts and sizes. We use these records to
          authenticate devices, route connections, prevent abuse, and diagnose service failures.

          Cloudflare hosts our Cloud service and processes network requests. Cloud uses IP-derived
          location estimates supplied by Cloudflare to select a nearby service region; this does not
          use your device’s GPS permission. Cloud temporarily buffers encrypted messages to allow
          interrupted connections to resume. Account and connection metadata remain accessible to
          the service even when message contents are encrypted.

          The agent tool running on your connected computer sends requests to its configured model
          provider. A request can include your prompt, relevant conversation history, code, files,
          images, browser content, and tool results needed for the task. An agent can also send
          information to websites or connected services when carrying out your instructions.
        </p>
        <p>
          The recipients depend on the agent, model, integrations, and account you configure.
          Provider policies include those of{" "}
          <a href="https://openai.com/policies/privacy-policy/">OpenAI</a>,{" "}
          <a href="https://www.anthropic.com/legal/privacy">Anthropic</a>,{" "}

          consult the operator of the endpoint configured in your agent tool.
        </p>
        <p>
          Providers handle requests under the terms for your account or API service. Retention,
          human review, and use for model training can vary by provider, product, and account
          settings. Cloud relay encryption does not prevent your selected provider from receiving
          task content. Review those settings before sending information, and stop using a provider
          or remove its credentials to stop future requests to it.

        <p>
          Browser Use is optional. The Chrome extension connects to Codevisor on the same computer
          so an agent can inspect and interact with your existing Chrome session. It handles tab
          information, requested history searches, page content, and browser actions for your task.
          Chrome displays its debugging indicator while Codevisor controls a tab.
        </p>
        <p>
          Codevisor also offers a separate managed browser and browser panes. Browser panes can
          route web traffic through the selected computer and synchronize browsing state and website
          cookies with that computer. Cookies may keep you signed in to websites, so this can make
          an authenticated website session available to the connected browser profile. Browser and
          plugin web views may store cookies, local storage, and cached content. Websites you visit
          receive requests and handle information under their own policies.

        <p>
          When you install a plugin through the app, we record your permission for that individual
          plugin in your Cloud account so it applies across your devices. The record includes its
          identifier, a hash identifying its source, the notice version, and the time you agreed. We
          keep an account-only index with its name, description, version, age rating, pane titles,
          and tool descriptions, including for unlisted plugins you approve. The consent record does
          not contain your workspace files, local paths, or repository credentials. We also store
          publishers you block so your iOS devices respect that choice.
        </p>
        <p>
          Plugin reports include your account identifier, the plugin’s identifier and name, your
          selected reason, any details you enter, and the report time. We store reports in our Cloud
          database and notify our team through Slack with the report identifier, plugin, reason, and
          details. Avoid including secrets or sensitive personal information. We use these records
          to investigate abuse, enforce our terms, and maintain safety. Account deletion removes
          consent and publisher-block records and removes your account link from retained reports.
          Reports and related Slack notifications may be retained as needed for investigations,
          repeat-abuse prevention, legal obligations, and resolving disputes.
        </p>
        <p>
          Plugins run on your connected computer and can display a pane inside Codevisor or add
          agent tools. Their panes receive workspace context, including the working directory and
          pane identifiers. Installing a plugin runs its declared commands on that computer.
          Depending on its code, a plugin can access files and other resources available to its
          process and send information to external services.
        </p>
        <p>
          Review the source, commands, tools, and privacy information of a plugin before installing
          it. Removing a plugin or a service credential stops the access that depends on it; it does
          not delete information the provider already holds. Use that provider’s controls or contact
          it for deletion. Browsing the plugin directory requests catalog information from Cloud,
          and installation can download code from the source repository and package services.

          selected product events to PostHog, such as opening the app, creating a chat, sending a

          Crash and error reporting in the macOS app is off by default. If you enable it, Codevisor
          uses Sentry to receive native crash stack traces and selected internal error identifiers.
          Reports may include the Codevisor version and build, macOS name and version, processor
          architecture, loaded binary identifiers needed for symbolication, and technical stack
          frames.

          We disable session recording, screenshots, automatic activity and network capture, and

          exception messages, and directory paths from technical stack traces.

          Reports are designed not to include prompts, responses, code, file paths, project names,

          website measurement runs separately from the optional analytics in the native app.

          We retain Cloud account and machine-registration records to provide your account until you

          Cloud relay message contents are encrypted between your devices. The relay routes and

          Hosted Cloud connections use HTTPS and secure WebSockets. Direct connections use the

          HTTP alone does not encrypt traffic. Native apps use the system keychain for their stored
