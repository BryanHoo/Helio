/// every machine publishes only its own entry, keyed by its server id, so
/// readiness can never conflict. Derived from the manager's live connection
/// state — a synced definition that cannot work somewhere (missing command,
/// ungranted OS permission) finally has a fleet-visible reason.
///
/// "mcp-overlays" — the one per-machine knob the fleet definition
/// deliberately does not carry: disable one MCP on one machine without
/// touching the fleet. Plain LWW entries any client writes via the generic
/// sync surface:
///   "enable|<serverId>|<name>"  → { enabled: false }   delete to restore
/// The name sits LAST in the key, so names may contain the delimiter;
/// server ids (uuid/hostname-shaped) must not.
