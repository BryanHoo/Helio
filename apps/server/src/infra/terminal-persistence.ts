/// The terminal manager's frame buffers are in-memory, so a server restart
/// (self-update handoff, `codevisor stop`, service restart) used to lose every
/// terminal's scrollback and break `lastOutputSeq` replay for reconnecting
/// clients. This module snapshots the buffers to `<dataDir>/terminal-buffers.json`
/// on every graceful exit path and restores them on the next boot.
///
/// Restored terminals are closed and process-less (the processes died with the
/// previous server): clients replay scrollback and see an exit, then create
/// fresh terminals as usual. Crash loss is acceptable — this covers graceful
/// exits, which is what host updates go through. All writes are synchronous so
/// they are safe inside `process.on("exit")`.
