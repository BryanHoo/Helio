/// app-hosted server can answer update questions truthfully:
///
/// - The CHANNEL file makes this machine the authority on which release feed
///   it follows. Sparkle installs from this machine's own alpha/stable
///   preference, so the server's update checks must read the same
///   preference — otherwise a remote client's requested channel can make
///   check and install disagree and an "update" never converges.
/// - The FEED file is the exact appcast URL Sparkle installs from. The
///   server reads "latest" from that same document, so what it reports and
///   what Sparkle installs can no longer disagree.
/// - The STATUS file reports the unattended Sparkle session's progress and
///   outcome, which the server mirrors into `/v1/update` as `lastApply` so
///   a remote client sees "failed: <why>" instead of timing out — and the
///   build Sparkle is actually installing, which may be older than the
///   feed's newest when Sparkle resumes an earlier download.
///
/// The app writes; the server only reads. File names must match the
/// server-side constants in `@codevisor/updater`'s app-hosted module.
