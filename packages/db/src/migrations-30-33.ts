    // UUID ids are compared byte-wise in TEXT columns, but clients disagree on
    // rendering (Swift uppercases, Node lowercases). Sessions never got the
    // lowercase canonicalization projects received, so opening a remotely
    // created (lowercase) session from the macOS app (uppercase paths) missed
    // the existing row and create-if-missing minted a case-twin duplicate —
    // the "duplicate agents/workspaces in the sidebar" bug. This migration
    // makes lowercase canonical everywhere and repairs the damage:
    //  1. Case-twin session groups are merged: twins without any transcript
    //     are phantom forks and are deleted outright; twins that were
    //     genuinely prompted are kept under a fresh lowercase id and archived
    //     so no data is lost but the duplicate leaves the sidebar.
    //  2. Session ids (and their child-table references) are lowercased.
    //  3. Project/worktree/workspace ids and uuid-shaped event subjects are
    //     lowercased where no differently-cased twin row blocks the rename.
