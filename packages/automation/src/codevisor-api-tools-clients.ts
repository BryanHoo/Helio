Optional focus defaults to false: create and arrange panes in the background, preserving the current pane and each surviving tab's selection. If the current leaf is moved to another tab, selection follows that same leaf. Set focus:true to select the result of new_tab/split/move/detach within the addressed workspace. Layout actions never open another workspace or foreground the window; use clients.navigate and clients.window explicitly when requested. Read supported actions and ids from clients.context. resize requires branchPath, positive fractions summing to 1, and expectedChildren matching that split's current child leaf ids to reject stale topology. reorder_tabs requires every current tab id exactly once. New Tabs are client-local until content is chosen in them; existing pane moves and sizes are local. Pane closing uses workspaces.pane_close. Returns acknowledged context.",
